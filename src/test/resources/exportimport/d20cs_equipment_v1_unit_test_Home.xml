A critical hit must be dealt for the sword''s death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword''s death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels.

However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.</description><type>EXOTIC</type><damage die="D10" numberofdice="1"/><critical hit="19" multiplier="2"/><combat>MELEE_WEAPON</combat><encumbrance>ONE_HANDED</encumbrance><category>NORMAL_WEAPON</category><enhancement>2</enhancement><family>Sword, bastard</family><rangeincrement>0</rangeincrement></weapon><weapon><name>Sword of Life Stealing</name><cost>25715.0</cost><weight>4.0</weight><quality>MAGIC</quality><description>This black iron +2 longsword bestows a negative level when it deals a critical hit.

An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</description><type>SHIELD</type><bonus>2</bonus><penalty>-2</penalty></armor><armor><name>Tower Shield</name><cost>30.0</cost><weight>45.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are.

The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells, a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else. When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield''s encumbrance.</description><type>SHIELD</type><bonus>4</bonus><penalty>-10</penalty></armor><armor><name>Adamantine Breastplate</name><cost>10200.0</cost><weight>30.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction of 2/-.</description><type>MEDIUM</type><bonus>5</bonus><penalty>-4</penalty></armor><armor><name>Banded Mail of Luck</name><cost>18900.0</cost><weight>35.0</weight><quality>MAGIC</quality><description>Ten 100-gp gems adorn this +3 banded mail.

Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature”s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature”s speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.

You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon (see Throw Splash Weapon, Player's Handbook page 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.</description><type>SPECIAL_SUBSTANCE</type></good><good><name>Antitoxin (vial)</name><cost>50.0</cost><weight>0.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.</description><type>SPECIAL_SUBSTANCE</type></good><good><name>Everburning Torch</name><cost>110.0</cost><weight>1.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it.

A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon (see Throw Splash Weapon, Player's Handbook page 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash. Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit) because the clerics are happy to supply people with what they need to battle evil.</description><type>SPECIAL_SUBSTANCE</type></good><good><name>Smokestick</name><cost>20.0</cost><weight>0.5</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater. A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assistig, does not need to make an attack roll, hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent (see page 268 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</description><type>SPECIAL_ITEM</type></good><good><name>Thunderstone</name><cost>30.0</cost><weight>1.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a –4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast. Since you don’t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5, if you miss, see Throw Splash Weapon, Player's Handbook page 158, to determine where the thunderstone lands.</description><type>SPECIAL_ITEM</type></good><good><name>Tindertwig</name><cost>1.0</cost><weight>0.0</weight><quality>NORMAL</quality><description>The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface.
