You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can''t choose to activate the body''s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature''s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).

A creature that enters the area while the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune, reads the rune, touches the rune, passes over the rune, or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can''t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>''s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the <i>symbol</i> reacts to touch. You can''t use a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> offensively, for instance, a touch-triggered <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can be based on a creature''s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don''t qualify.</p><p>When scribing a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the <i>symbol</i>''s effect.

If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered.
