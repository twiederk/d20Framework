Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for familiars are at the end of this section.<br/>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell''s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.<br/>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard''s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard''s opposition schools (see arcane school).<br/>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in Feats). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object''s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.<br/>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item.

While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you are considered flat-footed and lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC (if any).

You cannot use Acrobatics to move past foes if your speed is reduced due to carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor. If an ability allows you to move at full speed under such conditions, you can use Acrobatics to move past foes. You can use Acrobatics in this way while prone, but doing so requires a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC is increased by 5.

The base DC to make a jump is equal to the distance to be crossed (if horizontal) or four times the height to be reached (if vertical). These DCs double if you do not have at least 10 feet of space to get a running start. The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from. If you fail this check by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold of the other side after having missed the jump. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to make the jump and fall (or land prone, in the case of a vertical jump).

Creatures with a base land speed below 30 feet receive a -4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed below 30 feet. No jump can allow you to exceed your maximum movement for the round. For a running jump, the result of your Acrobatics check indicates the distance traveled in the jump (and if the check fails, the distance at which you actually land and fall prone). Halve this result for a standing long jump to determine where you land.</p><p>When you deliberately fall any distance, even as a result of a missed jump, a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall.

Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall''s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall.

(Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p><p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item''s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p><p>In some cases, the <i>fabricate </i>spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p><p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <i>ironwood </i>spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p><p>When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p><p>All crafts require artisan''s tools to give the best chance of success.

(If the result &times, the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you''ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &times, the DC doesn''t equal the price, then it represents the progress you''ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p><p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p><p><i>Progress by the Day</i>: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result &times, DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p><p><i>Create Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p><p><i>Repair Items</i>: You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place.

This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles.

An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.</p><ul><li> Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</li><li> Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</li><li> Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend another specific character.</li><li> Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn''t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</li><li> Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object.</li><li> Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</li><li> Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn''t go.</li><li> Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</li><li> Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</li><li> Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</li><li> Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability.)</li><li> Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</li></ul><p><i>Train an Animal for a General Purpose</i>: Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal''s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2 or higher.</p><p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.</p><ul><li> Combat Training (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes 6 weeks. You may also ''upgrade'' an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat by spending 3 weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal''s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Many horses and riding dogs are trained in this way.</li><li> Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes 3 weeks.</li><li> Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes 4 weeks.</li><li> Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes 2 weeks.</li><li> Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes 6 weeks.</li><li> Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes 5 weeks.</li><li> Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay.

This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p><p><i>Sniping</i>: If you''ve already successfully used Stealth at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack and then immediately use Stealth again. You take a -20 penalty on your Stealth check to maintain your obscured location.</p><p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use Bluff to allow you to use Stealth. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.</p><p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. Normally, you make a Stealth check as part of movement, so it doesn''t take a separate action. However, using Stealth immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if you''re moving.</p><p>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a bonus on Stealth checks (see Feats).</p>        ', 1, 1 );

You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow. If you are not trained in this skill, you can make untrained checks to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower.

The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.</p><p><i>Hard Ground</i>: Any surface that doesn''t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor.

A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the first table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you are trained in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.</p><p>A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.</p><p>If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a bonus on Survival checks (see Feats).</p>        ', 4, 1 );

If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p><p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath.

If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p><p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose.

You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you''re not and even if you don''t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you''ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can''t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but doesn''t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally risk when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p><p><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.</p><p><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you''re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don''t need to make this check.</p><p><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user''s alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p><p><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p><p><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a member of a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</p><p><i>Use a Scroll</i>: Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll''s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don''t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check.</p><p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p><p><i>Use a Wand, Staff, or Other Spell Trigger Item</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand''s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. Failing the roll does not expend a charge.</p><p><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can''t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You cannot take 10 with this skill. You can''t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p><p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you gain a bonus on Use Magic Device checks (see Feats).</p>        ', 5, 0 );
