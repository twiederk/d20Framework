Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity.<br/>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. <br/>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

(A druid can''t use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn''t a creature.)\nAt 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental''s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental''s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.<br/>At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.', 3, 'Ability' );

If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing. <br/><i>Accelerated Movement:</i> You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface, charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge. <br/><b>Action:</b> None.

INSERT INTO skill VALUES ( 3, 'Bluff', '<b>Check:</b> A Bluff check is opposed by the target''s Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target''s Sense Motive check for each one.<br/>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it''s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn''t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn''t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff. <br/>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a <i>suggestion</i> spell. <br/>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed. <br/><i>Feinting in Combat:</i> You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can''t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target''s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers. <br/>If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn. <br/>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it''s harder to read a strange creature''s body language, you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it''s even harder, you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it''s impossible. <br/>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity. <br/><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide: </i> You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity. <br/><i>Delivering a Secret Message: </i> You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can''t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive). <br/><b>Action:</b> Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn''t take an action, it is part of normal communication. <br/><b>Try Again:</b> Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round. <br/>Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication. <br/><b>Special:</b> A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy. <br/>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks. <br/>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. <br/><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you''re being observed and you try to act in character. <br/><b> Bluff Examples </b><table><tbody><tr><th>Example Circumstances</th><th>Sense Motive Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>The target wants to believe you.</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is believable and doesn''t affect the target much.</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target at some risk.</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at significant risk.</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to consider.</td><td>+20</td></tr></tbody></table>', 5, 1 );
INSERT INTO skill VALUES ( 4, 'Climb', '<b>Check: </b> With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees, a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more. <br/>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. <br/>A climber''s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. <br/>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC. <br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Climb DC</th><th>Example Surface or Activity</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the rope trick spell.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship''s rigging.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon or ruins.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>An overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface cannot be climbed.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>1=These modifiers are cumulative, use any that apply. <br/>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can''t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can''t use a shield while climbing. <br/>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage. <br/><i>Accelerated Climbing: </i> You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed). <br/><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds: </i> You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall. <br/><i>Catching Yourself When Falling:</i> It''s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall''s DC + 20) to do so. It''s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope''s DC + 10). <br/><i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing: </i> If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall''s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character''s fall but don''t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character''s fall and begin falling as well. <br/><b>Action: </b> Climbing is part of movement, so it''s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn''t take an action. <br/><b>Special: </b> You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner. <br/>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted. <br/>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks. <br/>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks. <br/>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing. <br/><b>Synergy: </b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination. <br/>', 0, 1 );
INSERT INTO skill VALUES ( 5, 'Concentration', '<b>Check: </b> You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn''t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted. <br/>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well. <br/>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one, any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed. <br/><br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Concentration DC (1)</th><th>Distraction</th></tr><tr><td>10 + damage dealt</td><td>Damaged during the action.

Also, damage stemming from an attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1 action) or the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action). <br/>3=Such as from <i>acid arrow.</i><br/>4=If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save. <br/><br/><b>Action: </b> None. Making a Concentration check doesn''t take an action, it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively). <br/><b>Try Again: </b> Yes, though a success doesn''t cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on. <br/><b>Special: </b> You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn''t apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity. <br/>The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell''s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn''t allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation, you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. <br/>A character with the Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned. <br/>', 2, 1 );
INSERT INTO skill VALUES ( 6, 'Craft', 'Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. <br/>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill. <br/><b>Check: </b> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft''s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.) <br/>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item''s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials. <br/>In some cases, the <i>fabricate</i> spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship. <br/>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <i>ironwood</i> spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel. <br/>When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. <br/>All crafts require artisan''s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan''s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. <br/>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps. <br/>1. Find the item''s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp). <br/>2. Find the DC from the table below. <br/>3. Pay one-third of the item''s price for the cost of raw materials. <br/>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week''s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you''ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x the DC doesn''t equal the price, then it represents the progress you''ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces. <br/>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. <br/>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again. <br/><i>Progress by the Day:</i> You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result x DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces. <br/><i>Creating Masterwork Items:</i> You can make a masterwork item - a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials. <br/><i>Repairing Items:</i> Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item''s price. <br/><br/>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table. <br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Craft Skill</th><th>Craft DC</th></tr><tr><td>Acid</td><td>Alchemy (1)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist''s fire, smokestick, or tindertwig</td><td>Alchemy (1)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone</td><td>Alchemy (1)</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Armor or shield</td><td>Armorsmithing</td><td>10 + AC bonus</td></tr><tr><td>Longbow or shortbow</td><td>Bowmaking</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Composite longbow or composite shortbow</td><td>Bowmaking</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating</td><td>Bowmaking</td><td>15 + (2 x rating)</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow</td><td>Weaponsmithing</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Simple melee or thrown weapon</td><td>Weaponsmithing</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Martial melee or thrown weapon</td><td>Weaponsmithing</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Exotic melee or thrown weapon</td><td>Weaponsmithing</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanical trap</td><td>Trapmaking</td><td>Varies (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Very simple item (wooden spoon)</td><td>Varies</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Typical item (iron pot)</td><td>Varies</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>High-quality item (bell)</td><td>Varies</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Complex or superior item (lock)</td><td>Varies</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>1=You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items. <br/>2=Traps have their own rules for construction. <br/><br/><b>Action: </b> Does not apply.

If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist''s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill. <br/><b>Synergy: </b> If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill. <br/>', 3, 1 );

A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it. <br/>The spells <i>fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol</i>, and <i>teleportation circle</i> also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. <i>Spike growth</i> and <i>spike stones,</i> however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details. <br/><br/>OTHER WAYS TO BEAT A TRAP<br/>It''s possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check. <br/><b>Ranged Attack Traps: </b> Once a trap''s location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism - assuming the mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it''s possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs. <br/><b>Melee Attack Traps: </b> These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute. <br/><b>Pits: </b> Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them - they break just as daggers do. <br/><b>Magic Traps: </b> <i>Dispel magic</i> helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap''s creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds.

If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action. <br/><i> ''Push'' an Animal: </i> To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn''t know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action. <br/><i>Teach an Animal a Trick: </i> You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following. <br/>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks. <br/>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so. <br/>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character. <br/>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn''t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated. <br/>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object. <br/>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching. <br/>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn''t go. <br/>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on. <br/>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate. <br/>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to. <br/>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability) <br/>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load. <br/><br/><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose: </i> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal''s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2. <br/>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. <br/>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also ''upgrade'' an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal''s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don''t require any additional training for this purpose. <br/>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks. <br/>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks. <br/>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks. <br/>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks. <br/>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks. <br/>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks. <br/><br/><i>Rear a Wild Animal: </i> To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. <br/>A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it''s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later. <br/><b>Action: </b> Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails. <br/><b>Try Again: </b> Yes, except for rearing an animal. <br/><b>Special: </b> You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do. <br/>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion. <br/>In addition, a druid''s or ranger''s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don''t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don''t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach. <br/>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks. <br/><b>Synergy: </b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks. <br/><b>Untrained: </b> If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can''t teach, rear, or train animals.

You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself. <br/><i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones: </i> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty. <br/>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim''s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell''s save DC. <br/><i>Treat Poison: </i> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher. <br/><i>Treat Disease: </i> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher. <br/><b>Action: </b> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work.

It''s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging. <br/>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16. <br/>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always, see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway. <br/>If people are observing you, even casually, you can''t hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you''re out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went. <br/>If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check, see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind.

This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast. <br/><i>Sniping: </i> If you''ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot. <br/><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide: </i> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. <br/><b>Action: </b> Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn''t take a separate action.

If you beat your target''s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target''s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile). <br/>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts. <br/><i>Demoralize Opponent: </i> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent''s resolve in combat.

If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile. <br/><b>Special: </b> You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target. <br/>A character immune to fear can''t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures. <br/>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. <br/><b>Synergy: </b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. <br/>', 5, 1 );
INSERT INTO skill VALUES ( 18, 'Jump', '<b>Check: </b> The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below). <br/>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet. <br/>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled. <br/>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round. <br/>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more. <br/><i>Long Jump: </i> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet). <br/>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don''t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. <br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Long Jump Distance</th><th>Jump DC (1)</th></tr><tr><td>5 feet</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>10 feet</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>15 feet</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>20 feet</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>25 feet</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>30 feet</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table>1 = Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC. <br/><br/><i>High Jump: </i> A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared. <br/>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet. <br/><table><tbody><tr><th>High Jump Distance (1)</th><th>Jump DC (2)</th></tr><tr><td>1 foot</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2 feet</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>3 feet</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>4 feet</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>5 feet</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>6 feet</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>7 feet</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>8 feet</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table>1 = Not including vertical reach, see below. <br/>2 = Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC. <br/><br/>Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.) <br/>Quadrupedal creatures don''t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature, treat them as being one size category smaller. <br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Creature Size</th><th>Vertical Reach</th></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>128 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>64 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>32 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>16 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>8 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>4 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>1 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Fine</td><td>1/2 ft.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><i>Hop Up: </i> You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start. <br/><i>Jumping Down: </i> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start. <br/>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did. <br/><b>Action: </b> None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump. <br/><b>Special: </b> Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed. <br/>If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start. <br/>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and athletic. <br/>If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks. <br/><b>Synergy: </b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks. <br/>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks. <br/>', 0, 1 );

You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you''ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can''t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn''t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself. <br/><i>Decipher a Written Spell: </i> This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher.

In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20.  This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature.

You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time. <br/><i>Use a Scroll: </i> If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll''s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don''t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above). <br/>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items. <br/><i>Use a Wand: </i> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand''s spell on your class spell list.
